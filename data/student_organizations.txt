STUDENT Activities

Why get involved when school work is already demanding so much of your time? Because there is much more to university life than just studying! There are friendships to nurture and interests to cultivate. There is also much to learn about creativity, leadership and teamwork – all of which are important to your personal growth and enrichment.


A wide variety of programs and activities that you can join to pursue your interests and broaden your horizons in HKUST. Stay tune with the email announcements (like “Student Support & Activities Weekly News” on Tuesdays, daily “HKUST Event Calendar”), HKUST Engage, notice boards on campus, or student organizations’ social media platforms. 


Student Organizations 
At HKUST, there are more than 100 student organizations that cater to various interests of students, including sports, community service, arts and culture, and academic affairs. They organize activities all year round to welcome new students, social gatherings for members, competitions, festivals, performances, etc.

 
More about the registered student organisations can be found HERE.

 
Reach out to them, join their activities, become a member or an officer bearer of the society/group appealing to you.


Student Advising
If you can’t find what you like, you are most welcome to initiate a new activity or form a new student society/group. We have Student Enrichment Activities Support (SEAS) Scheme to support individual students who want to initiate activities. Important information to facilitate student activity planning is available HERE.

 
Forming a new student society/group may require longer time and more considerations. You are recommended to prepare a proposal and seek advice from the Student Support & Activities Team.

The university provides Group Personal Accident Insurance to cover all students against accidental death, disablement, and accidental medical expenses arising from the recognized student activities. The Public Liability Insurance indemnifies students against legal liability to third parties in case of accidental bodily injury and/or accidental property damage incurred in these activities. Organizers are advised to arrange insurance for non-HKUST participants (including alumni) in your activities. Read the details HERE.

The university’s travel insurance covers HKUST participants in student-led outbound trips free of charge, but prior approval must be obtained from DSTO (FORM) or your sponsor department.

Guidelines and REGULATIONS

Important Guidelines for Student-Led Activities and Student Organizations- https://dst.hkust.edu.hk/upload/studentactivities/guideline_stdntledacty_stdntorg.pdf
Overview: These guidelines are developed by the Student Support and Activities Team of the Dean of Students’ Office (DSTO) for Students’ Union, SU-affiliated societies, 
Department-Associated Groups (DAGs), and activities supported by the Student Enrichment Activities Support (SEAS) Scheme. Departments and Offices are advised to adopt 
these guidelines to regulate other student activities they support. Section I: Student-Led Activities  
A. Discrimination, Harassment, and Vilification  Organizers have the responsibility to maintain a safe, inclusive and respectful environment for participants. 
All forms of discrimination, harassment, vilification, or hateful language or behavior will not be tolerated by the university as stated in the university’s Policy 
and may result in penalties for the organizing group and/or disciplinary action for individual students involved.  Organizers are expected to prevent or stop any of 
such misbehaviors in your activities, and make a discrimination/harassment report or complaint with the Equal Opportunities Officer (EOO) via email (eoad@ust.hk) when 
necessary.  
B. Group Insurances for Recognized Activities  The university provides Group Personal Accident Insurance to cover all students against accidental death, disablement, and 
accidental medical expenses arising from the recognized student activities. The Public Liability Insurance indemnifies students against legal liability to third parties 
in case of accidental bodily injury and/or accidental property damage incurred in these activities. Organizers are advised to arrange insurance for non-HKUST participants 
(including alumni) in your activities. Read the details HERE.  The university’s travel insurance covers HKUST participants in student-led outbound trips free of charge, 
but prior approval must be obtained from DSTO (FORM) or your sponsor department. Organizers should consult and submit the information at least two weeks before departure 
for consideration. Otherwise, organizers must arrange travel insurance for all participants to cover the entire trip. You can choose the university's Optional Travel 
Insurance Plan or other plans.   HKUST partners with International SOS (ISOS) to provide worldwide medical and security support for HKUST staff and students. Organizers 
are advised to review the medical and security information about the destination country for pre-trip planning. When medical or security assistance is needed during the 
trip, contact ISOS for support. Find details HERE- https://sfao.ust.hk/individual.php?l=66. 
C. Emergency Assistance and Incident Report Health and safety of organizers and participants should always be on top priority. Seek advice and assistance from and report 
any unsafe condition to DSTO whenever appropriate.  
Develop preventive measures for activities with high risks, such as physical demanding activities, outbound trip, and overnight activities. Have contingency plans to cope 
with emergencies and unforeseeable changes such as bad weather.  For all campus emergencies, seek help from or report to the Security Control Centre at 2358 8999 or 
2358 6565. Emergency procedures of the university are available HERE. Contact ISOS Assistance Center (852-2528 9900) when outside Hong Kong. Organizers must report 
incidents to DSTO immediately when there are hospitalization cases, serious injuries, incidents of violence or harassment, or loss/damage of valuable property.  
D. No Smoking, Alcohol, and Drug in Activities  Alcohol drinking and smoking are prohibited in all student activities, both on and off campus, as well as in student 
amenities managed by DSTO, including student halls. Organizers must not store, provide, or allow consumption of alcohol and cigarettes in all activities. Possession and 
consumption of dangerous drugs, and possession of any pipe or equipment for dangerous drug consumption, are criminal offenses under Cap. 134. Recreational drugs such as 
cannabis (CBD) and ecstasy are also illegal in Hong Kong. Organizers who facilitate or neglect to report drug use during events will be subject to severe consequences. 
E. Use of the Names and Logos of the University  The official full names of the university and its abbreviated and closely resembling names, including “HKUST” and “UST” 
in English, “香港科大”, “港科大” and “科大” in Chinese are all the “University’s Titles and Names”. The official emblem and the Red Bird Logo are the “University’s Logos”.  
Use of the names and logos of the university is governed by the university’s Policy and Guidelines. All HKUST members shall comply to protect these valuable assets. 
In principle, the university’s titles, names, and logos should not in association with commercial, political or other purposes without prior approval, whether by itself 
or as part of a student group’s  name or in any other format.  Enquiries on the use of the names and logos of the university should go to DSTO, which will assist in 
channeling applications, if any, to the appropriate authorities. 
F. Personal Data Privacy and Intellectual Property Rights  Personal data is protected by law (Cap. 486) 
and must be used for the purpose for which the data is collected or for a directly related purpose, unless voluntary and explicit consent with a new purpose is obtained 
from the data subjects. Organizers/data users are advised to prepare Personal Information Collection Statement (Guidance) if collection of personal data such as 
email address is required.  Respect and protect intellectual property rights are also important. Organizers must not use copyrighted materials, e.g. films, music, books 
and software, without permission (IP in HKSAR). Organizers must ensure that any materials created for the activity, such as logos, slogans, and designs, do not infringe 
on the intellectual property rights of others. 
G. Use of Campus Facilities  All campus facilities require booking and approval for use, except for LG3-LG5 Counter Zones and notice boards. You should inform the unit 
responsible for approving the venue before making any changes to the approved activity. Both organizers and participants should adhere to the guidelines for utilizing the
venue, as well as the instructions provided by university offices and staff. Do not use campus facilities to promote or organize activities for non-HKUST parties. Sale, 
money transaction, or commercial activities of any kind are not allowed, unless with prior approval. Promotional counters and materials can only be set up in the 
designated areas. Easy roll-up banners should be placed next to the designated counters.  Do not set up electrical wiring or any equipment/fixtures that could cause 
hazard/inconvenience to others. All waste and materials must be properly disposed of or removed at the end of the events appropriately. The university reserves the right 
to recover the reinstatement or cleaning cost incurred.  
H. Activity Publicity  Any publicity that contains profanity, insulting messages, discriminatory notes, or 
messages promoting violence and hatred will be removed promptly and may subject to penalty. For identification purposes, display banners, posters, or printed materials 
only in designated areas and clearly show the organizing group’s name, authorized chop and the expiry date. Logos or names of co-organizers or sponsors should not exceed 
1/10 of the size of promotional material, backdrop, brochure, etc., and should not be larger than the logo or name of the HKUST student organizer. Posters should be 
displayed for a maximum of two weeks before the activity and removed afterwards. Do not attach anything to painted surfaces, walls, windows, lockers, or other public 
areas on campus. Avoid using glue to stick promotion leaflets on surfaces. The Rules for Notice Boards are available HERE. Please consider environmental conservation and 
avoid putting up large numbers of publicity materials for one activity. Promotion through electronic media is encouraged.  
I. Career or Recruitment-Related Activities  Since handling job postings and recruitment/internship related activities need proper permissions and involve professional 
knowledge related to labour ordinances and immigration policies etc., organizers should not conduct such activities. Organizers may direct employers to Career Center 
(careercenter@ust.hk) for recruitment services.   For career education activities, such as interview workshop, career interest test or company visit, organizers should 
consult the Career Center in advance, otherwise, venue applications will not be endorsed.  
J. Sponsorships & Contracts  Organizers are prohibited from accepting monetary and 
non-monetary sponsorships from alcoholrelated or tobacco companies. Be cautious about sponsorships or arrangements that involve commercial activities for or by outside 
organizations. The name of university/student organization or project/activity should not be associated with or include commercial corporates or product names. Do not 
commit to contracts that involve the use of campus resources or sharing your members’ personal data unless you have consent from the data owners.  Before accepting any 
ponsorship, conduct research on the reputation, associations, and products of the potential sponsors. Assess the possible adverse impact and protect the image of the 
organization. Put all agreed terms in writing or in a contract. Study the conditions and terms of the contract/agreement carefully and be aware of the legal consequences 
of breaching or failing to fulfill the terms.  
K. Fund Raising  The university does not encourage student organizers to engage in activities involving fundraising as such 
activities can easily lead to undesirable consequences. Fundraising activities involving selling goods are not allowed. Student organizers should submit a fundraising 
proposal and an approval letter from the respective charitable organization(s) to the DSTO for endorsement. SU-affiliated societies should also submit a written consent 
from the Students’ Union. The university reserves the right to disapprove or terminate activities if not carried out as proposed. Organizers are required to submit a 
financial report, along with a valid receipt from the charitable organization, to DSTO (and the Students’ Union if applicable) within two weeks after the fundraising 
event. 
L. Activities with Outsiders, Celebrities or Media  Organizers should obtain approval from the university when activities held on campus that involve fee c
ollection from the public and when publishing print or online magazines, books, or journals intended for distribution to the public.  Student organizers must inform DSTO 
at least one month in advance and before confirming any celebrities (such as singers, KOLs, political figures) or media to participate in any activities on campus. The 
university may require the organizers to arrange for crowd and safety control during the activity and bear the cost incurred. Organizers should obtain written consent 
from participants before allowing celebrities or media to take photos or videos and share them publicly.  Organizers should confirm that outsiders or media do not use the 
activity for commercial or political purposes, and closely monitor the behavior of outsiders or media during the activity to ensure they comply with all relevant policies 
and regulations of the university. 

Section II: Registered Student Organizations 
M. Exco List and Society Email Account Registered student organizations, including 
Students’ Union, SU-Affiliated Societies, DepartmentAssociated Groups, should submit a list of executive committee members or group leaders to DSTO via the Student 
Organization Information System (SOIS), and inform DSTO whenever there is any change. An accurate record is required for granting eligible executive committee members or 
student leaders access to the designated university resources for student organizations. Most student organizations have an ITSC society email. To ensure security and 
appropriate use, reset the password of the assigned ITSC society email account whenever there is a change in the executive committee or student leaders. The password 
should only be known by the current executive members or student leaders and should not be shared with any other parties. Official announcements will be sent through the 
ITSC society email accounts, which serves as the official communication channel with the university and the means to book campus resources for society/group business. 
It is strictly prohibited to use the ITSC society email accounts for any other purposes. 
N. Public Activities and Financial Record  Student organizations are recognized 
by the university as groups serving university members, but most are not registered societies outside campus. Any activities or publications intended for individuals 
outside of the HKUST community may require additional permission as requested by the law, in addition to the endorsement of the university. Regardless of whether the 
organization has a society bank account or not, all financial transactions related to the organization should be properly recorded with original receipts and 
cross-checked by the Financial Secretary and the President or Leader (as applicable).  Individual students may bear personal liability legally and financially for the 
activities organized, even if they are organized under a student organization. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that all financial transactions are accurately recorded 
and documented, and these records are passed to the next cabinet for future auditing and tracking. 
Section III: Consequences for Violations or Non-Compliance with the 
Guidelines Student organizers who fail to comply with the guidelines may face penalties such as a written warning for minor cases, suspension of booking rights, forced 
community services, termination of funding support or other privileges, disciplinary record, or other penalties that to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Providing false information or incomplete information intentionally may lead to a more severe penalty. Note: This document offers only essential and general guidelines. 
Student organizations and activity organizers are encouraged to consult with DSTO for specific guidance while planning activities to reduce the risks of violating laws or 
university regulations and to ensure smooth execution and successful activities.

Student Representation on University Committees
	
Student Representation on University Committees
Student representatives hold seats on a number of University Committees which play decision-making or advisory roles in the formulation of policies and management matters. There are three major types of committees which include students as members:
The University Senate which is the supreme academic body of the University
Committees of the Senate, including:
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
Committee on Postgraduate Studies
Committee on Teaching and Learning Quality
Committee on Student Affairs
Student Disciplinary Committee
To fulfill the role of committee members, student representatives are encouraged to consult their fellow students for opinion and be prepared to exercise their best judgment in representing the interests of the student body. The student representatives are nominated by the University, their home schools, or by the relevant student bodies.
