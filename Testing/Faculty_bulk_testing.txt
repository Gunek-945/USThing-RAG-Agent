User: I am thinking of starting a project on machine learning, which profs. should I target from HKUST ?
Assistant: My friend, you're thinking of diving into the world of machine learning, eh? Well, you've come to the right place! HKUST has got some amazing profs who can guide you through the twists and turns of ML.

From what I've dug up, I'd recommend reaching out to Prof. James Tin Yau KWOK and Prof. Lei CHEN. Both of them have research interests that align with machine learning. Prof. KWOK has worked on artificial intelligence, which is a broad field that encompasses machine learning. Meanwhile, Prof. CHEN has expertise in data-driven machine learning, which is a crucial aspect of ML.

Additionally, you might also want to consider Prof. James Sai Ho KWOK, who has research interests in deep learning, neural networks, and artificial neural networks (ANN). These areas are all closely related to machine learning, and he might be able to offer valuable insights.

So, there you have it! These three profs could be great resources for your project. Just remember to approach them with a clear idea of what you want to achieve, and I'm sure they'll be happy to help.
