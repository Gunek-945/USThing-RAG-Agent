Degree Requirements\nTo earn the award of a bachelor\u2019s degree, all undergraduates must fulfill\u00a0approved requirements.\n18. Dual Degree\nStudents may earn two degrees by fulfilling all the requirements of both degrees. Students who fulfill\u00a0the requirements of two Major programs, but fulfill\u00a0the requirements of only one degree will not be awarded a dual degree.\n19. Exemption\nUnder certain circumstances, students may be granted an exemption from requirements for an award, or from the Aacademic Regulations.\n20. Extended Major\nExtended Major is not a standalone major. It is adhered to a certain relevant Major as expanded choices for students to enrich their Major study with cross-disciplinary applications of emerging technology and innovations relevant to their Majors. Details of all Extended Majors offered at the University are provided at \u201cProgram Catalog\u201d. All Extended Majors require the completion of least 21 credits in designated courses; and have attainment of an average grade point of at least 2.15 in courses taken within the Extended Major.\n21. First Major\nStudents who have registered for more than one Major program may be asked to nominate one of these majors as their First Major. Graduation from an Additional Major may not be possible within the normal duration of study for the award.\n22. Full-time Student\nAll undergraduate students are registered as full-time students. Full-time students must take a full credit load in each Regular Term, unless a reduced load has been approved.\n23. Grade Points\nCourses may be assessed for grade points. A table of grade points relative to letter grades is provided in AR 7.1.\u00a0Courses graded AU, DI, I, P, PA, PP, T and W do not count in the calculation of grade averages.\n24. HKUST Course Credits\nHKUST course credits are credits earned in courses included in the HKUST Course Catalog\u00a0and\u00a0do not include credits awarded through credit transfer from other institutions.\n25. Major Cumulative Grade Average (MCGA)*\nMajor cumulative grade average (MCGA) is based on the grade points earned for the courses used to fulfill the Major requirement and, depending on the Major, possibly also the corresponding School/AIS requirement for that Major. All courses used to fulfill the Major requirements, including the Extended Major and those of Additional Major(s), will be included in the calculation of MCGA. The Schools/AIS will determine if the School/AIS requirement should be included in the calculation of the MCGA and such decision will apply to all the Majors in the Schools/AIS in which the School/AIS requirement applies. Courses used to fulfill an Option (if any) embedded in a Major\u00a0will not be counted in the MCGA."

From what I've gathered, the department has a diverse range of faculty members, each with their own unique research interests and expertise.\n\nI've counted a total of 11 faculty members, including Assistant Professors Shuoqing DENG, Xinzhou GUO, Quoc HO, Qingyuan JIANG, Maximilian Alexander NITZSCHNER, Zhichao PENG, Shuaijie QIAN, Wei SU, Rong TANG, and Ke WANG. Each of them has an impressive background, with PhDs from renowned institutions like Universite Paris Dauphine, University of Michigan, The University of Chicago, and more.\n\nThe department seems to be quite active in research, with faculty members having their own personal websites and faculty profiles on the HKUST website. I'm sure they're all doing some fantastic work in their respective areas of mathematics!\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend checking out the HKUST website for more information on the Mathematics department and its faculty members.

            "response": "Starting a new society at HKUST, eh? That's a great idea! According to the guidelines, here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1. **Check if your society idea is already taken**: Make sure there isn't already a society that caters to your interests. You can check the list of existing societies on the HKUST website or consult with the Student Support & Activities team.\n\n2. **Gather support**: You'll need to gather a group of like-minded students who share your passion and are willing to join your society. This will show that there's a demand for your society.\n\n3. **Submit a proposal**: Prepare a proposal outlining the objectives, scope, and activities of your society. You'll need to submit this to the Student Support & Activities team for approval.\n\n4. **Get affiliated with the Students' Union (SU) or a department/office**: You can choose to affiliate your society with the SU or a specific department/office at HKUST. This will give you access to resources, support, and guidance.\n\n5. **Apply for registration**: Once your proposal is approved, you'll need to register your society with the University. This will involve submitting the necessary documents and information.\n\n6. **Set up an executive committee**: You'll need to elect an executive committee to manage your society. This committee will be responsible for making decisions, organizing events, and ensuring the smooth operation of your society.\n\n7. **Open a society bank account**: You'll need to open a bank account in the name of your society to manage your finances.\n\n8. **Apply for funding and resources**: You can apply for funding and resources from the University or external organizations to support your society's activities.\n\nRemember to consult with the Student Support & Activities team throughout the process to ensure you're meeting all the necessary requirements.\n\nSource: https://dst.hkust.edu.hk/eng/detail.php?catid=7&sid=51&tid=111&nid=28",
