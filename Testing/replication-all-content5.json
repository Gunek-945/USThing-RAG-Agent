I've got the scoop on the professors you can contact to learn more about your department. But don't worry, I won't give you a long list that'll make your eyes glaze over. I'll keep it short and sweet, just like me.\n\nHere are a few professors you can reach out to:\n\n1. Prof. Tim Cheng - He's the Department Head of Computer Science and Engineering, so he's the big cheese, the head honcho, the... you get the idea.\n2. Prof. Qiang Yang - He's a renowned expert in AI and machine learning, and he's always looking for talented students to work with.\n3. Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung - He's a professor of computer science and engineering, and he's worked on some really cool projects in the past.\n\nYou can find their contact information on the HKUST website. Just head over to the Computer Science and Engineering department page, and you'll find their email addresses and office hours.\n\nSo, there you have it! Now, go forth and impress these professors with your awesomeness!\n\nSource: https://cse.ust.hk/people/faculty\n\nP.S. Don't forget to attend the orientation and get familiar with the campus. It's a beautiful place, and you'll love it!",

According to the HKUST website ([www.ust.hk](http://www.ust.hk)), the Department of Mathematics at HKUST is one of the strongest in Asia, with research focuses on areas like algebra, analysis, geometry, and more! They also offer a range of undergraduate and graduate programs, because who doesn't love a good math problem, am I right?\n\nSo, if you're a math whiz or just a math enthusiast, HKUST's Math department might just be the place for you!
