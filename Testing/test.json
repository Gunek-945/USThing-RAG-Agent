Here's what you need to do:\n\nFirst, you need to submit a request for review to the department/unit level, stating the grounds for the request, describing the relevant facts, and providing supporting evidence. If the department/unit doesn't resolve the issue, you can appeal to the Dean of the School in writing within two weeks of receiving the decision, stating the grounds for the appeal.\n\nThe Dean will then determine whether to grant a further review of the grade and how it will be conducted. And, just to keep things clear, the Dean's decision is final.\n\nSo, that's the process! I hope it helps, and good luck with your appeal!\n\nSource: Academic regulations.txt",

Then, enter the online application system to check the locker number being assigned. If it suits your choice, proceed with the online application. Otherwise, you can cancel and apply again.\n\nNext, you'll need to submit your application. Applications are accepted online from 1 August every year, so mark your calendars! Make sure to read the FAQs, Rules, and Regulations for details before applying. You can submit your application via the \"Current Students\" section on the HKUST website, under \"myPortal\". Payment should be made online using Visa/Master Cards, Alipay, WeChat Pay, or Faster Payment System (FPS). Note that the locker fee is non-refundable, so make sure you're committed to that locker!\n\nFinally, to activate your locker, bring along a high-quality steel padlock of approved standard with a closed shackle (or a padlock with a short stem and a base of 35-40 mm wide) and the printed confirmation to LG3 Student Support & Activities Counter. The locker will be ready for use after 3 working days upon submitting the padlock.\n\nThat's it! You should now have a shiny new locker at HKUST.

This includes explosives, pets, and other hazardous materials.\n* It's not advisable to store valuable items like computers, cameras, and mobile phones inside the lockers, as the university won't be responsible for any loss or damage.\n* Students must take full responsibility for the items stored in their lockers.\n* Each student, including full-time/part-time UG, PG, and exchange-in students, is eligible to apply for one locker.\n* Students who have been successfully allocated a locker should bring a padlock of the approved type to the Student Support & Activities (SSA) Counter, then locate and take possession of the locker as soon as possible.\n* If the allocated locker is found to be occupied by someone else, students should report immediately to the SSA Counter at LG3 via Lift 6 of Indoor Sports Complex.\n* In case you need assistance to cut a padlock, an administration fee of $80 will be charged for the service contractor to open the locker.\n* Students will have to provide their own padlocks of approved standard, which includes high-quality steel-padlocks with closed shackle or a padlock with a short stem and a base of 35-40 mm wide from recommended brands like ASSA, ABLOY, TRI-CIRCLE, YALE, or BELLHORN.\n* Number padlocks, key retaining padlocks, and other unsafe padlocks will not be accepted.\n* The locker will be ready for use after 3 working days upon submitting the padlock to LG3 SSA Counter.\n* Lockers cannot be transferred or changed. In case of any problem, please contact the SSA Counter.\n\nThat's it! Just remember to follow these rules, and you'll be all set to use your student locker.\n\nSource: student_organizations.txt",

According to the student organization guidelines, you'll need to submit a list of executive committee members or group leaders to DSTO via the Student Organization Information System (SOIS). And don't forget to inform DSTO whenever there's a change in the executive committee or student leaders.\n\nThat's the basic step, but if you want more detailed information, I'd recommend checking out the university's website or contacting the Student Organizations office directly.
