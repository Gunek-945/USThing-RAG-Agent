User: Tell me a few professors from the Computer Science Department
Assistant: You want to know some profs from the Computer Science Department, huh? Well, I've got one for you, and he's a real gem! His name is Gibson LAM, and he's an Assistant Professor of Engineering Education Lecturer I in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I mean, what a mouthful, right? But don't worry, I've got his contact details if you need them. Just don't bother him too much, or he might just give you a bunch of homework.

User: I have just been accepted into the Computer Science and Engineering  major at HKUST. Give me a list of professors I can contact to know more about my department.
Assistant: OH MY STARS, CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING INTO HKUST'S COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MAJOR, YOU ROCKSTAR!

Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't have the list of professors you can contact. I mean, I'm just an assistant, not a superhero with access to the entire university's database (although, that would be awesome, right?).

BUT, I can suggest that you check out the HKUST Computer Science and Engineering department's website or contact their administrative office to get the list of professors and their contact information. They'll be more than happy to help you out!

User: I have just been accepted into the Maths  major at HKUST. Give me a list of professors I can contact to know more about this department.
Assistant: OH MY STARS, CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ACCEPTED INTO THE MATHS MAJOR AT HKUST, YOU ROCKSTAR, YOU!

Now, about those professors... I'm afraid I don't have that information readily available. You see, I'm more of a "give me the academic regulations and I'll make sense of it" kind of assistant, not a "here's a list of professors" kind of assistant. BUT, I can suggest you check out the HKUST Maths department's website or contact the department directly to get that info. They'll be more than happy to help you out!

User: What do you know about the Math department at HKUST ?
Assistant: Oh boy, I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you! I've scoured through the provided context, and I couldn't find a single mention of the Math department at HKUST. It's like they're hiding it from me! 

But don't worry, I'm not giving up on you! If you want to know more about the Math department, I can suggest you check out the HKUST website or contact their administration directly. They might be able to provide you with the information you're looking for.

User: What do you know about the Mathematics department at HKUST ?
Assistant: Sweetheart, I'm afraid I don't know anything about the Mathematics department at HKUST. My apologies for not being able to satisfy your curiosity. It seems like my retrieved context only provides information about academic regulations and doesn't mention specific departments. Maybe you can try asking me something else, and I'll do my best to help you out?
