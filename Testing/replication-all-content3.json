These requirements are minimum requirements for admissions. Holding these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.\nApplicants who possess other qualifications equivalent to the University requirements for admission may submit applications for admission, for consideration on the basis of individual merit.\nApplicants may be requested to attend personal interviews or take additional tests administered by the University.\n(Details of the University\u2019s admission requirements are available at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.2 Visiting Students\nStudents enrolled in tertiary institutions other than HKUST(GZ) who wish to study at the University on a short-term basis may be admitted as Visiting Students. Visiting Students may take courses, but are not enrolled on any specific program of studies.\n2.3 Admissions Process\nApplicants should observe the application procedures set out by the Undergraduate Recruitment and Admissions Office.\n(Details of the admissions process are set out at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.4 Re-admissions\nIf former students who have withdrawn from the University are re-admitted, course grades and credits may be used to fulfill their program requirements provided that (i) they had been achieved within five years prior to re-admission and (ii) had not been used to earn any award of the University or elsewhere (including HKUST(GZ)).\n<BACK>\n3.1 Maintaining Registration\nUndergraduate students are admitted as full-time students. Registration is confirmed only when students have completed the registration process and paid their tuition and other prescribed fees. Students who fail to maintain registration may be required to withdraw from the University.\n3.2\u00a0Double Registration\nUnless prior permission from the University is obtained, students are not permitted to concurrently register for another program at another post-secondary institution.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the restriction against double registration is not applicable to students of the University who have been approved to register as cross-campus student at HKUST(GZ), or vice versa.\n3.3\u00a0Study Commitment\nUndergraduate students may not engage in employment for more than 10 hours per week on average during a Regular Term. Any exception to this rule requires the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\n3.4\u00a0Normative duration of Study and Extension of Study\nStudents are expected to fulfill the requirements for an undergraduate degree within their normative duration of study, excluding any period of approved Leave from Study.\nUnless specified and so approved, the normative duration of study for all undergraduate degrees (excluding dual degree) is four years. Students who have been registered for their normative duration of study, excluding any Leave from Study, may extend their studies for one additional academic year with the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee. If approval is not granted to extend the duration of study beyond the normative duration, a student cannot continue to be registered at the University and is considered to have withdrawn from the University.\nStudents who have fulfilled the requirements for graduation may register as Associate Students. Associate Students must have their program of study approved by the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\nStudents extending their studies are subject to all University regulations and are entitled to normal student services. However, student housing is not available to such students.\n(Information on course fees for students extending their studies beyond the normative duration of study and for Associate Students is available under the \u201cTuition & Fees\u201d section.)\n3.5\u00a0Leave from Study"

These requirements are minimum requirements for admissions. Holding these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.\nApplicants who possess other qualifications equivalent to the University requirements for admission may submit applications for admission, for consideration on the basis of individual merit.\nApplicants may be requested to attend personal interviews or take additional tests administered by the University.\n(Details of the University\u2019s admission requirements are available at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.2 Visiting Students\nStudents enrolled in tertiary institutions other than HKUST(GZ) who wish to study at the University on a short-term basis may be admitted as Visiting Students. Visiting Students may take courses, but are not enrolled on any specific program of studies.\n2.3 Admissions Process\nApplicants should observe the application procedures set out by the Undergraduate Recruitment and Admissions Office.\n(Details of the admissions process are set out at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.4 Re-admissions\nIf former students who have withdrawn from the University are re-admitted, course grades and credits may be used to fulfill their program requirements provided that (i) they had been achieved within five years prior to re-admission and (ii) had not been used to earn any award of the University or elsewhere (including HKUST(GZ)).\n<BACK>\n3.1 Maintaining Registration\nUndergraduate students are admitted as full-time students. Registration is confirmed only when students have completed the registration process and paid their tuition and other prescribed fees. Students who fail to maintain registration may be required to withdraw from the University.\n3.2\u00a0Double Registration\nUnless prior permission from the University is obtained, students are not permitted to concurrently register for another program at another post-secondary institution.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the restriction against double registration is not applicable to students of the University who have been approved to register as cross-campus student at HKUST(GZ), or vice versa.\n3.3\u00a0Study Commitment\nUndergraduate students may not engage in employment for more than 10 hours per week on average during a Regular Term. Any exception to this rule requires the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\n3.4\u00a0Normative duration of Study and Extension of Study\nStudents are expected to fulfill the requirements for an undergraduate degree within their normative duration of study, excluding any period of approved Leave from Study.\nUnless specified and so approved, the normative duration of study for all undergraduate degrees (excluding dual degree) is four years. Students who have been registered for their normative duration of study, excluding any Leave from Study, may extend their studies for one additional academic year with the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee. If approval is not granted to extend the duration of study beyond the normative duration, a student cannot continue to be registered at the University and is considered to have withdrawn from the University.\nStudents who have fulfilled the requirements for graduation may register as Associate Students. Associate Students must have their program of study approved by the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\nStudents extending their studies are subject to all University regulations and are entitled to normal student services. However, student housing is not available to such students.\n(Information on course fees for students extending their studies beyond the normative duration of study and for Associate Students is available under the \u201cTuition & Fees\u201d section.)\n3.5\u00a0Leave from Study"

These requirements are minimum requirements for admissions. Holding these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.\nApplicants who possess other qualifications equivalent to the University requirements for admission may submit applications for admission, for consideration on the basis of individual merit.\nApplicants may be requested to attend personal interviews or take additional tests administered by the University.\n(Details of the University\u2019s admission requirements are available at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.2 Visiting Students\nStudents enrolled in tertiary institutions other than HKUST(GZ) who wish to study at the University on a short-term basis may be admitted as Visiting Students. Visiting Students may take courses, but are not enrolled on any specific program of studies.\n2.3 Admissions Process\nApplicants should observe the application procedures set out by the Undergraduate Recruitment and Admissions Office.\n(Details of the admissions process are set out at\u00a0https://join.hkust.edu.hk/.)\n2.4 Re-admissions\nIf former students who have withdrawn from the University are re-admitted, course grades and credits may be used to fulfill their program requirements provided that (i) they had been achieved within five years prior to re-admission and (ii) had not been used to earn any award of the University or elsewhere (including HKUST(GZ)).\n<BACK>\n3.1 Maintaining Registration\nUndergraduate students are admitted as full-time students. Registration is confirmed only when students have completed the registration process and paid their tuition and other prescribed fees. Students who fail to maintain registration may be required to withdraw from the University.\n3.2\u00a0Double Registration\nUnless prior permission from the University is obtained, students are not permitted to concurrently register for another program at another post-secondary institution.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the restriction against double registration is not applicable to students of the University who have been approved to register as cross-campus student at HKUST(GZ), or vice versa.\n3.3\u00a0Study Commitment\nUndergraduate students may not engage in employment for more than 10 hours per week on average during a Regular Term. Any exception to this rule requires the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\n3.4\u00a0Normative duration of Study and Extension of Study\nStudents are expected to fulfill the requirements for an undergraduate degree within their normative duration of study, excluding any period of approved Leave from Study.\nUnless specified and so approved, the normative duration of study for all undergraduate degrees (excluding dual degree) is four years. Students who have been registered for their normative duration of study, excluding any Leave from Study, may extend their studies for one additional academic year with the approval of the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee. If approval is not granted to extend the duration of study beyond the normative duration, a student cannot continue to be registered at the University and is considered to have withdrawn from the University.\nStudents who have fulfilled the requirements for graduation may register as Associate Students. Associate Students must have their program of study approved by the relevant Dean or the Dean\u2019s designee.\nStudents extending their studies are subject to all University regulations and are entitled to normal student services. However, student housing is not available to such students.\n(Information on course fees for students extending their studies beyond the normative duration of study and for Associate Students is available under the \u201cTuition & Fees\u201d section.)\n3.5\u00a0Leave from Study"

They organize activities all year round to welcome new students, social gatherings for members, competitions, festivals, performances, etc. Most of these student organizations are either affiliated with the HKUST Students' Union or associated with different departments/offices of the university.\n \nSU-affiliated societies and DSTO-associated student groups can apply to the Student Support & Activities team for temporary storage space, a mailbox, a group email, access to shared work areas, and eligibility of booking various activity rooms, all subject to availability.\n\n \nStudents' Union, Student Societies\nThe Students' Union (SU) is a registered society under the Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151) and established by HKUST students who choose to become SU members. It operates independently from the University, and as such, any stances or initiatives undertaken by the SU are not indicative of the University's viewpoints or actions.\n \nThere are about 80 student

Exco List and Society Email Account Registered student organizations, including \nStudents\u2019 Union, SU-Affiliated Societies, DepartmentAssociated Groups, should submit a list of executive committee members or group leaders to DSTO via the Student \nOrganization Information System (SOIS), and inform DSTO whenever there is any change. An accurate record is required for granting eligible executive committee members or \nstudent leaders access to the designated university resources for student organizations. Most student organizations have an ITSC society email. To ensure security and \nappropriate use, reset the password of the assigned ITSC society email account whenever there is a change in the executive committee or student leaders. The password \nshould only be known by the current executive members or student leaders and should not be shared with any other parties. Official announcements will be sent through the \nITSC society email accounts, which serves as the official communication channel with the university and the means to book campus resources for society/group business. \nIt is strictly prohibited to use the ITSC society email accounts for any other purposes. \nN. Public Activities and Financial Record  Student organizations are recognized \nby the university as groups serving university members, but most are not registered societies outside campus. Any activities or publications intended for individuals \noutside of the HKUST community may require additional permission as requested by the law, in addition to the endorsement of the university. Regardless of whether the \norganization has a society bank account or not, all financial transactions related to the organization should be properly recorded with original receipts and \ncross-checked by the Financial Secretary and the President or Leader (as applicable).  Individual students may bear personal liability legally and financially for the \nactivities organized, even if they are organized under a student organization. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that all financial transactions are accurately recorded \nand documented, and these records are passed to the next cabinet for future auditing and tracking. \nSection III: Consequences for Violations or Non-Compliance with the \nGuidelines Student organizers who fail to comply with the guidelines may face penalties such as a written warning for minor cases, suspension of booking rights, forced \ncommunity services, termination of funding support or other privileges, disciplinary record, or other penalties that to be considered on a case-by-case basis. \nProviding false information or incomplete information intentionally may lead to a more severe penalty. Note: This document offers only essential and general guidelines. \nStudent organizations and activity organizers are encouraged to consult with DSTO for specific guidance while planning activities to reduce the risks of violating laws or \nuniversity regulations and to ensure smooth execution and successful activities."

Posters should be \ndisplayed for a maximum of two weeks before the activity and removed afterwards. Do not attach anything to painted surfaces, walls, windows, lockers, or other public \nareas on campus. Avoid using glue to stick promotion leaflets on surfaces. The Rules for Notice Boards are available HERE. Please consider environmental conservation and \navoid putting up large numbers of publicity materials for one activity. Promotion through electronic media is encouraged.  \nI. Career or Recruitment-Related Activities  Since handling job postings and recruitment/internship related activities need proper permissions and involve professional \nknowledge related to labour ordinances and immigration policies etc., organizers should not conduct such activities. Organizers may direct employers to Career Center \n(careercenter@ust.hk) for recruitment services.   For career education activities, such as interview workshop, career interest test or company visit, organizers should \nconsult the Career Center in advance, otherwise, venue applications will not be endorsed.  \nJ. Sponsorships & Contracts  Organizers are prohibited from accepting monetary and \nnon-monetary sponsorships from alcoholrelated or tobacco companies. Be cautious about sponsorships or arrangements that involve commercial activities for or by outside \norganizations. The name of university/student organization or project/activity should not be associated with or include commercial corporates or product names. Do not \ncommit to contracts that involve the use of campus resources or sharing your members\u2019 personal data unless you have consent from the data owners.

Assess the possible adverse impact and protect the image of the \norganization. Put all agreed terms in writing or in a contract. Study the conditions and terms of the contract/agreement carefully and be aware of the legal consequences \nof breaching or failing to fulfill the terms.  \nK. Fund Raising  The university does not encourage student organizers to engage in activities involving fundraising as such \nactivities can easily lead to undesirable consequences. Fundraising activities involving selling goods are not allowed. Student organizers should submit a fundraising \nproposal and an approval letter from the respective charitable organization(s) to the DSTO for endorsement. SU-affiliated societies should also submit a written consent \nfrom the Students\u2019 Union. The university reserves the right to disapprove or terminate activities if not carried out as proposed. Organizers are required to submit a \nfinancial report, along with a valid receipt from the charitable organization, to DSTO (and the Students\u2019 Union if applicable) within two weeks after the fundraising \nevent. \nL. Activities with Outsiders, Celebrities or Media  Organizers should obtain approval from the university when activities held on campus that involve fee c\nollection from the public and when publishing print or online magazines, books, or journals intended for distribution to the public.  Student organizers must inform DSTO \nat least one month in advance and before confirming any celebrities (such as singers, KOLs, political figures) or media to participate in any activities on campus. The \nuniversity may require the organizers to arrange for crowd and safety control during the activity and bear the cost incurred. Organizers should obtain written consent \nfrom participants before allowing celebrities or media to take photos or videos and share them publicly.
