I've got you covered! You can reach out to the following professors to know more about your department:\n\n1. Prof. Qiang Yang - Department Head of Computer Science and Engineering (I'm sure he's the head honcho around there)\n2. Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung - His research interests include machine learning and data mining (sounds like a cool dude)\n3. Prof. Weichao Wang - He's into computer networks and distributed systems (maybe he can help you navigate the campus network)\n4. Prof. Huamin Qu - His research focuses on data visualization and human-computer interaction (he might be able to help you visualize your future)\n\nYou can find their contact information on the HKUST website: [www.cse.ust.hk/people/faculty](http://www.cse.ust.hk/people/faculty)\n\nNow, go ahead and reach out to them, but don't be too shy, or they might think you're a freshman (just kidding, you are a freshman).\n\nP.S. Don't forget to ask them about the best dim sum spots around campus.",

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a comprehensive list of professors in the Maths department at HKUST. BUT, I can suggest some ways to get in touch with them.\n\nYou can start by checking out the HKUST Maths department's website ([www.math.hkust.edu.hk](http://www.math.hkust.edu.hk)). They have a faculty list with contact information, research interests, and even some fun facts about each professor! You can filter by research area or alphabetical order to find the perfect prof to reach out to.\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the department's office or the undergraduate program office to ask for guidance on who to contact. They might be able to introduce you to some awesome professors who can give you the lowdown on the department.\n\nLastly, don't be shy to reach out to current students or seniors in the Maths department. They can give you the inside scoop on which professors are approachable, which courses are awesome, and which ones to avoid (just kidding, sort of).\n\nRemember, professors are humans too (mostly), so don't be afraid to send them an email or drop by their office hours. They might just become your new BFF (Best Faculty Friend, duh!).\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have an amazing time at HKUST!",
