I've got the scoop for you! You can reach out to the following professors to know more about your department:\n\n1. Prof. Qiang Yang - Department Head of Computer Science and Engineering (he's the big cheese, so be sure to impress him with your coding skills)\n2. Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung - His research interests include machine learning and data mining (perfect for all you AI enthusiasts out there!)\n3. Prof. Weichao Wang - He's into computer networks and distributed systems (if you're into building the next big thing, he's your guy)\n4. Prof. Huamin Qu - His expertise lies in data visualization and human-computer interaction (if you're all about making tech user-friendly, he's the prof for you)\n\nYou can find their contact information on the HKUST website: [www.cse.ust.hk/people/faculty](http://www.cse.ust.hk/people/faculty)\n\nNow, go forth and impress them with your tech-savviness!
